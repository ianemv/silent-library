        I wonder if the person who ask these question went through out the whole Philippines, as far as i know, Filipinos in general look similar from each other. The only differences is the Language and Tradition, but Filipinos can also be look diverse in appearance, some of us can look like Latino, Indian, Chinese, Arab, etc. But most of us look similar from each other. Also, there's no such thing as Northern and Southern Filipinos because we all look similar lmao
